				WORKSHOPS. PROFESSIONAL SPEAKERS. NETWORKING. CODE. DESIGN. ART. MUSIC. FOOD. VIDEO GAMES.

			<p class="jam-descript" id="intro">
				Whether you’re a game programming wizard, a level 90 artist, or just a video game enthusiast, this event is a great way to experiment with game concepts, talk to professional game developers and artists, and meet others like you -- craftspeople with a passion for realizing their technical or creative skills in a fun larger context. 
				<br><br>
				Don't worry if your game isn't exactly as you envisioned, or if you don't finish! We encourage you to submit whatever you have, however incomplete it may be. Feel free to work after the deadline and expand on your prototype, too -- what you make is completely yours.
				<br><br>
				No experience? If you don’t know any art or programming, this is the perfect excuse to learn, whether on your own or from experienced peers! Pick and choose what to attend and build a curriculum that suits you!

			<p class="heading jam-descript" id="slogan">F A Q</p>
			<p class="text-blob" id="faq-blob">
				DO I NEED TO COME WITH A TEAM ALREADY FORMED?
				<br> No! Everyone will have some time to think and pitch an idea. Collaborate with new friends or peers you admire. If you have a great idea you want to bring to life on your own, you can do that too.
				<br>
				<br> DO I NEED SPECIAL SKILLS TO PARTICIPATE?
				<br> No -- this is just as much an experience to learn as to create! Budding designers, developers, artists and anyone is welcome to try their hand at making a game. Even if you have no experience at all, you can still participate by contributing ideas, playtesting, and giving moral support to your team. Plus, our workshops will give you enough knowledge to help you fiddle with the game engines themselves.
				<br>
				<br> I CAN’T DRAW (OR MAKE MUSIC, OR…) -- CAN WE USE ASSETS?
				<br> Yes! And you’re encouraged to explore the wide world of assets floating around on the internet. Just make sure that authors are credited. This applies to sounds and graphics likewise.
				<br>
				<br> WHAT MEDIUM (ENGINE) DO WE HAVE TO USE?
				<br> Whatever works best for you! Our list of resources is just the beginning. Digital, or non-digital, RPGMaker, GameMaker, Twine, Unity, UnrealEngine --  the choice is yours, so long as your game adheres to the theme.
				<br>
				<br> DO I HAVE TO STAY THE WHOLE TIME?
				<br> Come and go as you, or your team, pleases! You can leave, come back, do some work, and join us for our pizza dinner on Friday night at 9:00.
				<br>
				<br> HOW DO I TURN MY WORK IN?
				<br> Send a zip file of all of your work to cugamedev@gmail.com and join us for the Game Jam Showcase, Friday, October 21st  in Broadway Hall's Main Lounge to play everybody’s games and hear from a special keynote speaker!
				<br>
				<br> <br> Feel free to ask us any other questions on our Facebook page or send us an email at cugamedev@gmail.com.
